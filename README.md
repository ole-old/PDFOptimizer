# PDFOptimizer HowTo

1) Double click run the file Install_PDFOptimizer.bat inside the PDFOptimizer directory. This will bring up two installation wizards one by one for the following dependencies:
  a) Ghostscript
  b) GraphicsMagic
The installation wizards are easy to follow, but just to provide more support the guides for installation of these two dependencies have been included in the package. These guides contain screenshots of each scren that comes up while installing these modules and highlight the actions to be taken by the user on each screen.

2) Double click run the file Launch_PDFOptimizer.bat, this will kickstart the pdf optimization engine. A commandline (cmd) window will appear with the following line getting printed at the start "PDF optimization engine is up and running..". Leave this window opened, you can minimise it if you wish to and thats it. The PDf optimization service is now running and pointing to the local(residing on the same machine) couchdb server.
