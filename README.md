# PDFOptimizer
## How To Run
1.	Go to the project root folder ("PDFOptimizer"), on my system it is accomplished by typing the following command on the prompt and pressing return:
cd <space> D:\PDFOptimizer\PDFToImagebook
2.	Now type the following command and press return:
node <space> app <space> url_of_target_couch_server*
* url_of_target_couch_server  would be replaced with http://127.0.0.1:5984 if target couchdb server is your local windows machine and it has no admins configured on it. If it is admin protected then the format of url_of_target_couch_server becomes http://admin_username:password@127.0.0.1:5984
